To make a move in the game you can just click on the piece you want to move, and all the possible moves will be hightlighted.
As indicated by the rule of chess, your move can't give away your king. Our model is smart enought to detect and hide those illegal moves.
The game also includes special moves such as Castling, En Passant or Pawn promotion. 

All player movements can be viewed on the left side of the board:

After each move, the program will check the situation on the board and indicate if the game has reached an end.


Good luck and have fun!
